# WebViewer Linearization Sample

[WebViewer](https://docs.apryse.com/web/guides/get-started) is a powerful JavaScript-based PDF Library that is part of the [Apryse SDK](https://apryse.com/). It provides a slick out-of-the-box responsive UI that enables you to view, annotate and manipulate PDFs and other document types inside any web project.

- [WebViewer Documentation](https://docs.apryse.com/web/guides/get-started)
- [WebViewer Demo](https://showcase.apryse.com/)

This repo is designed for users who are planning to setup a web-optimized viewing experience using WebViewer in their application. 


## Get your trial key

A license key is required to run WebViewer. You can obtain a trial key in our [get started guides](https://docs.apryse.com/web/guides/get-started), or by signing-up on our [developer portal](https://dev.apryse.com/).


## Initial setup

Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).


## Install


```
cd client
npm install
```

For Server: 
```
cd server
npm install
```

### Install WebViewer Core Dependencies

The preferred method to install the Core dependencies is to use the [WebViewer NPM package](https://docs.apryse.com/documentation/web/get-started/npm/#1-install-via-npm).

Once installed, copy the Core & UI folders into the path being used by the viewer for its dependencies 
/client/public/webviewer/lib

A post install script (copy-webviewer-files.cjs) is included to automate this process

## Run

Client: 
```
npm run dev
```

Server: 
```
npm run start
```


## Project structure

```
client/ 
    node_modules/       - required dependencies

```


## How to use
